# Hi there! I'm Aidan.

I'm a software engineer and creative currently living in Albuquerque, NM.

I like to make things that help people learn while they're having fun.

I make [code](https://github.com/SnailBones), [words](https://medium.com/@snailbones), and <ScrollLink to=".gallery">more</ScrollLink>.

Why the name? I'm a big fan of [plants](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/29496000).

Want to [make something together?](mailto:aidhendrickson@gmail.com)
