# Lamplight

Play as a moth in this atmospheric action game, very loosely inspired by Flappy Bird.

Flap the wings with the mouse and search for a twinkling firefly. Move near the lights to see yourselfâ€”but don't collide with them or you'll burn!

Released for Windows on [itch](https://ailanthus.itch.io/lamplight).
