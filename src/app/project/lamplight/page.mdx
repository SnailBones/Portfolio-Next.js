# Lamplight

Play as a moth in this atmospheric action game inspired by the idea: "What if flappy bird actually involved flapping?"

Move the mouse up and down to flap your wings and search for a twinkling firefly. Move near the lights to see yourselfâ€”but don't collide with them or you'll burn!

Released for Windows on [itch](https://ailanthus.itch.io/lamplight).
