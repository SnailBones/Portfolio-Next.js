# Nature Now

## Design for a modern-day, technology enhanced diarama.

Natural history dioramas ubiquitously display an idealized past, where wild creatures exist free from humans or signs of our influence. In a world where our species' influence permeates every corner of the globe, the environments they portray no longer exist.

Built for an exhibit design course at Colorado College, **Nature Now** is my design for a present day diorama and technology-enhanced museum exhibit that presents its nonhuman inhabitants in their unflinchingly human-altered surroundings. This diorama portrays a **novel ecosystem**â€”a human-built habitat where introduced species from around the globe now coexist and form new relationships. Specifically, it recreates a small stream in Colorado Springs.

The stream's banks have been stabilized with concrete, and its tributaries are now subterranean culverts draining the city streets. Litter is common, and the flora is dominated by introduced plant species. Nonetheless, unexpected diversity flourishes, with species adapting to interact in ways that they never have before. **Nature Now** encourages viewers to examine an often overlooked space.

The back wall of the exhibit features a large touch screen, displaying a food web demonstrating natural and novel relationships between species. Touching any species brings it into the center of the web, providing further information about its relationship with our species, and pulls up additional info including pictures and a map of local sightings reported by citizen scientists using with data from iNaturalist.

By communicating these interspecies interactions and drawing attention to both our culture's environmental impact and the diversity that remains in spite of it, **Nature Now** encourages action toward sustainability and caring for the overlooked nature in our neighborhoods.
