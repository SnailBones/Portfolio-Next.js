# What Trees Were

### A procedural art generator

_What Trees Were_ began as a Computer Graphics final project and evolved into a creative tool for all your tree-generation needs. Tweak the ruleset to create the tree of your dreams. Tree manipulator connoisseurs can use a advanced mode allowing for interpolation between two rulesets in one tree.

Made from scratch in Java.
