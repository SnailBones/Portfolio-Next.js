# Electric Power Fast

As part of my role as Creative Developer at [RS21](https://rs21.io/), I built a **Vue.js** interface for [Argonne National Lab's](https://www.anl.gov/) _Electric Power Fast_ simulation, aka _EPFast_. I worked closely with ANL's researchers and UI designer [Calvary Fisher](https://calvaryfisher.com/) to design and build an interactive visualization and interface for interacting with their simulation.

EPFast models disruptions to the electric power system, their cascading destructive effects (think dominos) and the resulting **fragmentation of the grid into _"islands"_**. The model works on any electric grid, and we ultimately tested the application on a model of the Eastern Interconnect, **the connected portion of the US electric grid stretching from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic ocean**. The data and visualization covers three affected components:

_Nodes_ include generators (i.e. power plants), loads (i.e. residential or commercial consumers of electricity) and transformers.

Power _lines_ connect the grid, animated and labeled to show the directional flow of energy. Electricity always "tries" to move from generators to loads, so when one line is broken (usually by a natural disaster), the energy passing through parallel lines will increase. If the amperage in one of these lines becomes greater than its capacity, it must shut down to avoid damage. Unfortunately, each line that shuts down forces more electricity through other lines, causing a cascade of uncontrolled disruption.

Eventually, a disrupted electric grid stabilizes into _islands_â€”networks of connected nodes that have become isolated through disrupted lines. In a severe disruption, many or most islands will have no functional electricity, causing an outage. Islands with both generators and loads will retain full or partial power. In my visualization, islands are visualized as polygons in their approximate area, and selecting an island highlights its lines, providing insight into its structure.

Designing the visualization for islands was a complex task: they needed to be intuitive enough for nontechnical users to interact with, but display the detail necessary to inform expert's decisions. I iterated through prototypes and experimented with visualization techniques, ultimately **designing a visualization that clearly demarcates each island with a polygon created by taking the intersection of its nodes' convex hull with their section of a Voronoi diagram**. I implemented this visualization with **Turf.js** and **Mapbox GL JS**.

Another challenge was the large scale of the data. After I had built the application testing on the electric grid of Puerto Rico, the customer revealed their Eastern Interconnect model, covering over half the continental US and consisting of **over 150,000 nodes**. Delivered as a massive JSON response, the scale of the data would often freeze the application. I worked to reduce the stored data size as much as possible, and modified the visualization to improve performance and reduce visual clutter. At lower zoom levels, I implemented heatmaps displaying the locations where the most electricity generation and consumption has been lost, and a smooth transition between the heatmap and individual nodes as the user zooms in and out.
