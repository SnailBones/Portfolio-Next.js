# Seeing Beyond

For the **Seeing Beyond** exhibit at the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum, I developed an interactive visualization to be projected on the gallery walls, providing a new perspective to two of O'Keeffe's paintings. Clouds responded to visitors presence by creating mounds in the cloudscape in response to each person's location in the room detected with Microsoft Kinect sensors. Starting with a prototype created by another engineer, I crafted procedurally generated 3d clouds by combining 3d simplex noise with sensor depth data, and to visualize them I implemented a ray-marching GLSL shader simulating the effects of light passing through the atmosphere. Using a custom configuration menu, I adjusted the visualization on site to match the colors of Georgia O'Keeffe's paintings and reflect the goals of the exhibit's director.

Seeing Beyond was on display at the Georgia O`Keeffe museum in Santa Fe from November 2019 through August 2022.
