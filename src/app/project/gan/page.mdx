# Renaissance GAN

For my senior capstone project at Colorado College, I worked on a team to build a neural network model for creating music and art.

My team set out to explore the question: can computers be creative? We put it to the test by building a convolutional Generative Adversarial Neural Network (GAN). By training two competing networks, a GAN learns to output data resembling its input.

We were among the first to apply a GAN to music gerenation. We did this by applying by converting MIDI files into images, reducing the problem of music generation to that of image generation. Elongating our convolutional kernel shape improved the GAN's ability to play chords by recognizing the relationship of notes in time. Our model produces multi-track songs resembling the human-generated input.

I designed our network in Keras, and built the supporting data infrastructure in Python.
