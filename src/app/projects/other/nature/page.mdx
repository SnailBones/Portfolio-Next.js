# Nature Now

## Exhibit Design Coursework at Colorado College

A **novel ecosystem** is a human-built or modified niche of the Anthropocene. We live surrounded by novel ecosystems, yet they receive remarkably little formal attention.

Notably, natural history dioramas are ubiquitously displays of the past. In a world where our species' influence permeates _every_ ecosystem, the environments they portray no longer exist.

**Nature Now** is my design for a present day diorama that presents its nonhuman inhabitants in their unflinchingly human-altered surroundings, and emphasizing novel juxtapositions and interactions between species. This complexity is illustrated on a large touch screen on the back wall, displaying a food web including natural and novel relationships between species. Touching any species brings it into the center of the web, providing further information about its relationship with our species, including a map of local sightings reported by citizen scientists.

This exhibit encourages viewers to examine an often overlooked space: a small stream in suburban Colorado Springs. Its banks have been stabilized with concrete, and its tributaries are now subterranean culverts draining the city streets. Litter is common, and the flora is dominated by introduced plant species. EVen so, unexpected diversity flourishes, with species adapting to interact in ways that they never have before.

By communicating these interspecies interactions and drawing attention to both our culture's environmental impact, and the diversity that remains in spite of it, **Nature Now** encourages action toward sustainability.
