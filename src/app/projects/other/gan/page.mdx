# Renaissance GAN

For my capstone project at Colorado College, I worked on a team to build a neural network model for creating music and art.

We used a Generative Adversarial Neural Network (GAN). By training two competing networks, a GAN learns to output data resembling its input. While GANs are commonly applied to image generation, we applied the same technique to generating music by reducing the problem of music generation to that of image generation. Using a two-dimensional convolutional GAN and the MIDI file format, our model produces multi-track songs resembling the human-generated input.
